# Hi, I'm Hanna

> I am currently studying to be Front End Developer at Medieinstitutet in Stockholm, Sweden.<br>
I am also looking for LIA/intership for the fall of 2023.

My strength is my bottomless drive and my accuracy for perfection. I highly value being part of a
productive team, where my colleagues and I work together towards a mutual goal.
At the start of the LIA, I will have knowledge of working in **Vanilla JS & TypeScript**. I will be able to
implement **SCSS** and use **current web development frameworks**. Other skills I will
know includes **testing my own code**, and **develop database-driven applications**.
